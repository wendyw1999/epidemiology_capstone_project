## General info
- Use covid-19 datasets provided by JHU to fit epidemiology model to U.S.. After figuring out the infection parameter, we can then predict 

## Introduction
Fitting Epidemiology Model with Covid-19 JHU U.S. Data
## Technology
Project is created with:
* xx version: 12.3
* yy version: 2.33
* zz library version: 999
## ðŸ“¦ Setup
- Before running, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages
- on terminal, run `python run.py data` to retrieve the most current data from JHU & Apple Data

## ðŸš€ Directions
`python run.py test` to start

## ðŸ“„ Processing

### Achievements

### Problem to Solve

- [TODO] Using Apple's mobility data, we are able to fit a Bayesian model and use the model to predict future number of infected with new lockdowns/un-lockdowns.
