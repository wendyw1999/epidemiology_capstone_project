# Fitting Epidemiology Model with Covid-19 JHU U.S. Data
## Description of Data and Directories

- Before running, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages
- on terminal, run `python run.py data` to retrieve the most current data from JHU & Apple Data

### Problem to Solve
- Use covid-19 datasets provided by JHU to fit epidemiology model to U.S.. After figuring out the infection parameter, we can then predict 
infected number for future.
- [TODO] Using Apple's mobility data, we are able to fit a Bayesian model and use the model to predict future number of infected with new lockdowns/un-lockdowns. 


## Data should not be touched at all times!
# Directions
`python run.py test` to start
